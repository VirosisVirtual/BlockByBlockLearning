      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container2a">
      <h2>What is Minecraft?</h2>
      <p>Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game where players can explore a 3D-generated world composed mainly of blocks, similar to legos. This project utilizes the game's creative mode where players can freely build with any blocks in the game with no restrictions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container2b">
      <h2>Who is this project's intended audience?</h2>
      <p>Block by Block Learing was designed with the Minecraft's rating of 10+ age for students who have an interest in video games. The game is simplistic which anyone can participate without much prior knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container2a">
      <h2>What is required to participate in the project?</h2>
      <p>Block by Block Learning requires a valid Java Edition Minecraft copy or Bedrock Edition copy on desktop. Crossplatform is possible but is currently not supported by the site.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container2b">
      <h2>How do I download and use the world files?</h2>
      <p>Each page has its own respective download link for Java and Bedrock. Once you have downloaded the file you must place the zip/world files in their respective folders. For more info you can view the technical requirements section.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container2a">
      <h2>Is there a structured curriculum?</h2>
      <p>BBL is a flexible, project-based learning experience rather than following a strict curriculum. Teachers can adapt the project to fit various subjects such as environmental science or STEM as they see fit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container2b">
      <h2>Are there any rules that need to be followed?</h2>
      <p>Because the project is based in a sandbox game, we want to make sure there aren't any specific rules since some factors such as temperature and habitability cannot be simulated properly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container2a">
      <h2>What is the intended goal of this project?</h2>
      <p>This project aims to provide students a space to build and design their own worlds within these scenarios. By using their creativity and knowledge students can explore real-world concepts while articulating the functionality and purpose behind their designs.</p>
